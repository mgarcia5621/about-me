                Lately I have been playing minecraft , very relaxing game to be honest. Well... only when the game 
                wants to be. I have decided that I should stop going into creative , and play for real. I have gotten lots 
                progress in 22 days (minecraft days) , it was quite fun to be honest. I learned new things just from playing 
                the game , I learned what a composters can do. If you throw any type of food inside it grows a layer , and when 
                the composter fills up all the way it can turn into "Bonemeal". Bonemeal is used to make crops grow faster if you 
                don't feel like waiting , And as y'all should know I am not patient when it comes to my crops. I made a gorgeous 
                5x5 house , if you would like to check it out here is a photo.
