                Lately I have been playing minecraft , very relaxing game to be honest. Well... only when the game 
                wants to be. I have decided that I should stop going into creative , and play for real. I have gotten lots 
                progress in 22 days (minecraft days) , it was quite fun to be honest. I learned new things just from playing 
                the game , I learned what a composters can do. If you throw any type of food inside it grows a layer , and when 
                the composter fills up all the way it can turn into "Bonemeal". Bonemeal is used to make crops grow faster if you 
                don't feel like waiting , And as y'all should know I am not patient when it comes to my crops. I made a gorgeous 
                5x5 house , if you would like to check it out here is a photo.

            <p>On a normal week , I like to get all my work done.
                Then I get some coding done , after that is all done I eat my lunch.
                I go about my day till it is time to take a shower, when I get out 
                I get on the computer to play some games with my cousin and a friend.
                Days like this are usually good ones , It is very nice and simple. But if I had a choice
                I would like a life that would have me wondering what is going to happen next , I want 
                to wake up thinking I wonder what today holds for me. I want to get better at coding because , 
                it can really open up doors for someone young like me. Not many have the resources that I do , 
                so I must utilize my tools to get me a good part time job in the future. Because with this 
                coding , I can learn new things and maybe pass it on to my kids. But only if they want to , 
                I will not force them to do something they don't want to.
